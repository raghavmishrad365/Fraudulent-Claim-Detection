# Fraud Detection in Insurance Claims

## Introduction
This project aims to help Global Insure improve its fraud detection process using machine learning. By analyzing historical claim data and customer profiles, we build a model to classify incoming claims as fraudulent or legitimate, enabling early intervention and reducing financial losses.

## Problem Statement
Global Insure processes thousands of insurance claims every year, with a notable percentage being fraudulent. The current manual fraud detection approach is inefficient and often too late in identifying fraudulent claims. This project provides a data-driven solution to detect potential fraud earlier in the claim processing lifecycle.

## Business Objective
Develop a machine learning model that accurately classifies insurance claims as either fraudulent or legitimate, based on historical data such as claim amount, customer demographics, and claim types.
